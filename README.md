USDA Food nutrient database interface

Grails app with domain classes mapping USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference (sr23). The app contains domain classes for all elements of the database as well as a service for obtaining detailed nutrient information for a specific food given an amount and number of servings. The app was designed for release 23, but likely would work with future releases by the USDA.
